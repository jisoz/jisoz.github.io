    <h3>EKS CSI Drivers & Secure Storage Management</h3>
    <p>
        Implemented Kubernetes CSI drivers on Amazon EKS to enable dynamic, cloud-native storage and secret
        management. Deployed the EBS CSI Driver to provision persistent block storage for stateful workloads
        using ReadWriteOnce volumes, and the EFS CSI Driver to provide shared ReadWriteMany storage for
        multi-pod applications. Integrated the Secrets Store CSI Driver with AWS Secrets Manager using OIDC
        and IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA), allowing pods to securely retrieve secrets at runtime
        without storing sensitive data in Kubernetes manifests.

    <h3> AWS EKS Infrastructure with Terraform & IAM Integration</h3>
    <p>
        Provisioned an AWS VPC and Amazon EKS cluster using Terraform, deploying the cluster across 
        multiple Availability Zones for high availability. Implemented IAM users and IAM roles integrated
         with Kubernetes RBAC, using Roles and RoleBindings to control user and workload access within the cluster,
         enforcing least-privilege permissions for administrative and application-level operations.
     </p> 
</div>
<div class="project-card">
    <img src="assets/vpc.png" alt="AWS VPC Architecture">
    <h3>AWS Production VPC with High Availability & Secure Access</h3>
    <p>
        I designed and implemented a production-grade AWS infrastructure using a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with public and private subnets across multiple Availability Zones.
        The architecture uses an Application Load Balancer and Auto Scaling Group to ensure high availability, scalability, and fault tolerance.
        For security, application servers are deployed in private subnets with no direct internet access, while outbound traffic is handled through NAT Gateways deployed per Availability Zone.
        A Bastion Host is implemented in the public subnet to provide secure administrative access to private EC2 instances.

        <h3>Private GitLab Server & CI/CD Pipeline</h3>
        <p>
        I designed and implemented a private GitLab server with enterprise-grade CI/CD capabilities. 
        The setup includes multiple GitLab Runners, including a primary runner and a backup runner, to ensure high availability and efficient pipeline execution. 

        This solution enables secure version control, automated builds, testing, and deployment of applications. 
        The GitLab server is accessible via a custom domain with SSL, and the runners use Docker executors for isolated, reproducible job environments. 
        It mirrors real-world DevOps workflows, supporting scalable, reliable CI/CD pipelines for development and production environments.

    <h3>BackUp Solution for MSSQL Database</h3>
    <p>
        Designed and implemented a  backup strategy for <strong>APP-4-LEGAL</strong> to ensure data integrity and enable point-in-time recovery. The strategy includes:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Full Backup (Sunday):</strong> Complete database backup serving as the baseline.</li>
            <li><strong>Differential Backups (Monday–Friday):</strong> Captures all changes since the last full backup; only the last full + differential are needed for restoration.</li>
            <li><strong>Transactional Log Backups (Hourly during business hours):</strong> Records all transactions for precise point-in-time recovery.</li>
        </ul>
        This <strong>Full + Differential + Log</strong> approach ensures faster restores, minimal data loss, and smooth recovery for large databases.
